"The Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship historical narrative project examines the history of the Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship at Emory University in the context of national, local, and university-wide events that has transformed the United States and the campus of Emory University since the 1960s. The narrative project details the life and philosophical ideology of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the project explores the impact of Dr. King's legacy at predominately-white institutions throughout the United States. From its humble beginnings in April 1968, the story of the Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship is a glimpse into the broader history of faculty, staff, student, and alumni activism at Emory University. The historical narrative of the Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship explores Emory's efforts to service the financial and academic needs of Black students, unify campus communities, celebrate African-American cultural traditions, and form strategic partnerships with Atlanta, Newton County, and local businesses. Having served Black and brown students for over five decades, the Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship continues today as Emory's oldest scholarship for minority students.",2021 Hamm,"""Daniel Hamm, author and 2017 Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship recipient.

I dedicate this narrative to all of the King Scholars who have and will grace the gates of Emory University. I am thankful for all of the King Scholars who have impacted my life before, during, and beyond my tenure at Emory including: Mrs. Andrea Hardon (1990 King Scholar recipient and my middle school teacher); Ms. Cheryl Turner (1990 King Scholar recipient); Mr. Jonathan Butler (1992 King Scholar recipient and my mentor); Ms. Tianna Bailey (1997 King Scholar recipient); Ms. Tye Tavaras (2005 King Scholar recipient); and Mr. Jamariel Hobbs (2014 King Scholar recipient).

I am thankful for all of the support that I have received from various Emory alumni, staff, and professors in conducting this written narrative project. Finally, I want to thank Emory University Archivist John Bence for advising this narrative project.""",,Report,"Daniel, Hamm, Emory University",,2021-05-01,vmfsm,,text,vmfsm,the-history-of-the-emory-mlk-jr-scholarship-edited.pdf;descMetadata.xml,History of the Emory MLK Jr. Scholarship;Descriptive Metadata,,,,Emory University.
